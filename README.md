# morse-code-translator
A modular program that takes input in a .txt file and converts it into morse code. Outputs in another .txt file

The program uses Windows_morseLetters.txt and Mac_morseLetters.txt to translate the text into morse code.

The text to be translated must be written down in a .txt file and uploaded somewhere the program has visibility to.
The program will ask for the name of the input file, and then the name for the output file. The output file will be created with the translated morse code inside and placed in the same repository that the input file was
located in.
